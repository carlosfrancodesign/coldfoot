            <p>
                If we are to believe that Darwinist laws of nature can be applied to sociology, economics, and politics,
                we may also presume natural selection factors into any competitive market. In the grocery aisle, Sally
                can choose from six or seven brands of chocolate bar, but Willy Wonka pays a pretty slotting fee to get
                his chocolate on the shelf so she can see it. The market remains competitive because Willy Wonka is not
                paying to win, he is simply paying to play, and Sally does not have to buy his chocolate bar. In a free
                market, they say the best goods and services rise to the top and that competition is better for the
                consumer because Sally has more options to choose from. Others say this presents her with the illusion
                of choice.
            </p>

                If the true aim of any serious voting body is to achieve consensus, we may also presume that consensus
                selects those best suited to represent the will of the majority. An idiocratic voting body, such as The
                Recording Academy™, adheres to this principle fully when a minority consortium of card-carrying members
                (in good dues standing) vote to award the best in Music with the coveted GRAMMY©.

            <h2>The Gut-Brain-Third-Eye Axis</h2>
            <p>
                Before prediction markets, the truth that reality is predetermined was a privilege reserved for
                red-pilled, bored ape degens such as myself. However, the market makers behind scheduled community events like Astroworld or the Super Bowl have now confirmed the existence of our simulation to be self-evident. Sally can now walk into Kalshi, strut over to the "Civil Unrest" aisle, pick up a few endocrine-disrupting boxes of 'Yes' or 'No' and be on her merry way. Only Sally is on a dirty bulk ready to walk out with the whole flippin' store. Kalshi relies on Sally's broken Gut-Brain axis, which fuels her appetite for calorie-dense morsels of dopamine. In order to profitmax from the pre-programmed outcomes only privy to the developers and beta testers, Sally must start a clean bulk, select a feeding window, and spend her calories wisely, even if that means forgoing the Kendrick Krispies and Bad Bunny-O's for some Olivia Dean Cuisine. Once she can trust her Olivia Rodrigo GUTS, she can trust what I dub "Simulation Brain."
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tradition of the Greats, I have re-branded a time-tested theory of probability for our current era. Whereas Occam's Razor states that the outcome with the fewest assumptions is the most favorable, Simulation Brain purports the outcome with the fewest assumptions to be the most likely. In other words, the simplest outcome to justify is the most likely. By this logic, it would seemingly behoove us to channel our most ooga-booga tendencies when braving the choppy Polymarket waters. But any old rodeo clown knows that the more likely the outcome, the less "value" there is from risking your hard-earned, dollar-backed Robux. Professional gamblers throw around the v-word in an attempt to legitimize their monetized addiction, but it is nothing more than a pickled red herring aimed at throwing your grubby little nose off the scent of far less sexy, reasonable plays hiding in plain sight. The true alpha lies within this key distinction of the Simulation Brain: if the outcome with the fewest assumptions is the most likely, then the most likely outcome is also the most obvious. Now put your money where your brain is.

            <h2>2FA</h2>
            <p>
                Prediction markets possess several edges over traditional sportsbooks. The platforms are 100% legal. No regulatory gray areas or offshore casinos. You can often fund your accounts more easily thanks to partnerships and better UI. Prices move as people buy and sell shares instead of being set periodically by oddsmakers. But it's always good to check in on your homies and boot up the 360. While you goon to the Robinhood weeklies, the true value lies within the precious time it takes for the bookies to dial up the World Wide Web and catch up to the tabloids. This exact strategy is how I locked Sean Baker in as a second or third underdog after pouncing on the DGA news before the books changed the odds (Baker went on to pretty much run a one-horse race).

                In Music, artists compete for publicity that leads to a boost in streaming performance, known as The Grammy Effect. Last year, Billie Eillish saw a 47% boost in streams without winning a single above-the-line category, despite being favored to win Song of the Year. Voters are encouraged to cast their ballots with this in mind.
