            <p>"This too shall pass," I repeat to myself, down $713 USD in my Kalshi billfold. I'm a paltry player on the
                leaderboards, going toe-to-toe with the Claude Code mafia. That's alright. They say the house always
                wins, and I'm making myself right at home until Awards Season 2k26 is said-and-done.</p>
            <h2>The Three Billie Goats Gruff</h2>
            <p>Going into the weekend, I discussed the Gut-Brain-Third-Eye Axis. I forgot to mention I have astigmatism.
                Even with corrective lenses, I couldn't see the Billie B2 Bomber breaking the sound barrier. Hooah. As a
                small consolation, none of the sports pundits saw this one coming. Whoever did churned a pretty penny on one of the longest shots of the night. Billie Eillish is now the only artist in history to receive this particular trophy three times.</p>
                <p>Often the odds ebb with
                insider information. This one flying completely under the radar has a nasty stench to it, especially in
                light of Billie's recent headline-attracting vocal activism. The Grammy's
                have always been Eurovision, but now they align more closely with an Obama-era White House
                Correspondant's Dinner. About a year ago, a fork in the Simulation made this path uncertain. I'm afraid
                we are officially, as GRAMMY-winner Tame Impala says, back in our old ways again.
            <p>

            <p>There were at least two surprises that gave me my money's worth. With less conviction here, I only put a latte down on The Cure finally receiving some awards recognition in Best Alternative Album
                and Lola Young stealing Pop Solo Performance from Treasure Goblin Sabrina Carpenter. I wish I had included a blurb about these calls in the last letter since I'm hunting for
                validation anywhere I can get it, so I'm including it here.</p>
            <h2>The Gold Under The Bridge</h2>
            <p>Song of the Year AKA the FIFA© Peace Prize was certainly handed to the Big Billie Goat on account of her
                mouthpiece. WILDFLOWER was released as a late single for her 2024 album Hit Me Hard and Soft, where it contented last Awards Cycl and blanked. Detractors say this was a deliberate move
                to exploit eligibility windows. Either way, the Sirens continue claiming bodies and it makes me sick. The Golden Glitch has officially been nerfed and the bill comes due.</p>
            <h2>GOD DID</h2>
            <p>The GRAMMY's theocratic regime is officially in full swing. I overcorrected on King Kendrick and the Goliath Jelly
                Roll Holy Roll, thinking The Rapture was a little farther off, so I'm definitely kicking myself under the pews. I'm also saying my Hail Mary's for Natalia Lafourcade. KAROL G's numbers didn't add up and I strayed from the light. Kelsea Ballerini walked me straight into the honeypot. The Latin Pop and Contemporary Country categories were competitive AF this year and I failed to resist the temptation of the Devils in a Pink Dress. Although my Tyler Childers conviction was ironclad, there is a valuable lesson in buying "No" shares for tight categories such as these, lest I end up on the Bitin' List. American Country Music, Incorporated is clearly facing desperate times. Resorting to the off-shore Zach Top LLC slush fund was the reasonable choice in the end.</p>
                <p>God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. As I was bleeding out, Patron Saint Benito came saying, "sana, sana, colita de rana." By nights end, most of my wounds were healed.</p>
