                <h1>Let ICE Sort Em Out</h1>
            </div>
        <article>
            <p>"This too shall pass," I repeat to myself, down $713 USD in my Kalshi billfold. I'm a paltry player on the
                leaderboards, going toe-to-toe with the Claude Code mafia. That's alright. They say the house always
                wins, and I'm making myself right at home until Awards Season 2k26 is said-and-done.</p>
                <h2>The Coffee Rule</h2>
                <p>There were at least two upsets I chased with The Coffee Rule, betting smaller units on underdogs that you back with less conviction. For me that means staking the cost of an iced Latte, around $8.50 (adjusted for inflation). Sometimes it's a Cortado, sometimes it's House Drip.</p>
            <p>Up first was The Cure, finally receiving some recognition for Best Alternative Album. The Career Achievement factor combined with the lack of Awards recognition should have made this a lock, but the price remained undervalued. The additional posthumous element always helps. Second, Lola Young stole Pop Solo Performance from Random Spawn Treasure Goblin Sabrina Carpenter, who was almost overpriced across the board as the defending Champ. Messy was the de facto fit for this category, coupled with the fact that no other performer has won this award back-to-back since Adele.</p>
            <p>I wish I had included a blurb about these calls in the last letter since I'm hunting for
                validation anywhere I can get it, so I'm including it here. Earnings are going straight back into the Little Sweet Treat Fund.</p>
            <h2>The Three Billie Goats Gruff</h2>
            <p>Last week we learned the Gut-Brain-Third-Eye Axis. I forgot to mention I have astigmatism.
                Even with corrective lenses, I couldn't see the Billie B2 Bomber breaking the sound barrier. Hooah. As a
                small consolation, none of the sports pundits saw this one coming either. Whoever did churned a pretty penny on one of the longest shots of the night. Billie Eillish is now the only artist in history to receive this particular trophy three times.</p>
                <p>Often the odds ebb with
                insider information. This one flying completely under the radar has a nasty stench to it, especially in
                light of Billie's recent headline-attracting vocal activism. The Grammy's
                have always been Eurovision, but now they align more closely with an Obama-era White House
                Correspondant's Dinner. Only a year ago a fork in the Simulation made this path uncertain, but I'm afraid
                we are officially, as GRAMMY-winner Tame Impala says, back in our old ways again.</p>
            <h2>The Gold Under The Bridge</h2>
            <p>Song of the Year AKA the FIFA© Peace Prize was certainly handed to the Big Billie Goat on account of her
                mouthpiece, even though WILDFLOWER was released as a leftover radio single from Hit Me Hard and Soft, which contended in the 2025 Awards Cycle and blanked. Detractors say this was a deliberate move
                to exploit eligibility windows. Either way, the Siren continues claiming bodies and it makes me sick. The Golden Glitch has officially been patched and the billie came due.</p>
            <h2>GOD DID</h2>
            <p>The GRAMMY's theocratic regime has arrived. I overcorrected on King Kendrick and the Goliath Holly Rolling Jelly
                Roll, thinking The Rapture was a little farther off, so I'm kicking myself under the pews. I'm also saying my Hail Mary's for Natalia Lafourcade. I would say stop the steal, but KAROL G's numbers were confusing from the jump and I strayed from the light. Kelsea Ballerini walked me straight into the honeypot with the egregious lead in the Sportsbooks, blinding me to the obvious Childers "No" play. A reminder that 2FA has its pitfalls. The Latin Pop and Contemporary Country categories were extremely competitive this year and I failed to resist the temptation of the Devils and their Pink Dresses.</p>
                <p>I stand behind my conviction against Tyler Childers, but I missed the opportunity to buy "No" shares against Snipe Hunter instead of aping into too-good-to-be-true Ballerini. This will be a rule for tight categories such as these, lest I end up on the Bitin' List once again. American Country Music at large is clearly facing desperate times and I'll take my Zach Top miscalculation in stride.</p>
                <p>Alas, God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. As I was bleeding out, Patron Saint Benito came saying, "sana, sana, colita de rana." By nights end, most of my wounds were healed.</p>
